# tribute-page
This is my attempt at completing the first front end development project for freeCodeCamp. I heard a talk on the life of Samuel Morse, and how he developed the telegraph and Morse Code. I found the story interesting and thought it might make an interesting tribute page. This page is styled almost exclusively in Bootstrap.
