          <h3>Death of Samuel's first wife</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">While working in Washington DC in 1825, Samuel Morse received a letter delivered by horse that his wife, had died. Samuel had not even been aware that she was ill. He left immediately for home, but did not arrive until after she was buried.
            Heartbroken, he decided to explore a means of long distance communications.</p>
          <h3>Invention of telegraph and Morse Code</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">in the 1830s, several people were working on a means of long distance communications. Morse developed a way to send a signal over long distances of wire using relays. His solution was less expensive than other systems developed at the time.
            He also developed a method of transmitting messages over the telegraph using a combination of short and long signals called Morse Code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code" target="_blank">Morse Code</a> which is still in use
            today.

          <h3>Later Life</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">Samuel fought for many years for his patent on the telegraph because his patent was often contested or ignored. This fight went all the way to the supreme court of the USA, where he won a partial victory. As a result, he became wealthy in his
            later years. In in 1848 he married his second wife Sarah. Samuel had 7 children, three with his first wife, Lucretia, and four with his second wife.</p>
